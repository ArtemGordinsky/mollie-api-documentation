Integrating meal vouchers
=========================
A meal voucher is a voucher for a meal given to employees as an employee benefit, allowing them to
eat at outside restaurants, typically for lunch. In many countries, meal vouchers have had favorable
tax treatment. Vouchers are typically in the form of paper tickets but are gradually being replaced
by electronic vouchers in the form of a special payment card. It's possible to accept these cards
via Mollie.
