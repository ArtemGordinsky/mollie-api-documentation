- [Source Code](https://github.com/mollie/api-documentation)

We take pull requests on our documentation as well, if you think that something can be improved please open a PR.

The documentation is formatted using [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/rest.html). All
documentation should be written in US English.

Note that PhpStorm comes with a reStructuredText plugin. You can enable it from the Plugins preferences pane. It enables
some syntax highlighting.

### Prerequisites

- Python > 2.7.9
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), Python's package manager. [Installation instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
- Node > 9.x

### Running locally

Create a fork, or clone this repository if you have write access:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:mollie/api-documentation.git
```

Then visit the downloaded repository and install dependencies:

```shell
cd api-documentation
make install
```

### Generate HTML and supporting files

Finally, build the documentation, its CSS and JS files by running:

```shell
make html
```

You can now preview the generated documentation by opening `build/html/index.html`:

```shell
open build/html/index.html
```

### Making changes to copy

After running `make html` at least once, you can use `make html-only` to quickly update the HTML files if you changed
some copy. This way, you can have a quick [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

```shell
$ make html-only
Running Sphinx v1.7.1
...
updating environment: 0 added, 2 changed, 0 removed
...
build succeeded.

The HTML pages are in build/html.
$ open build/html/index.html
```

Sphinx will only update files for which the source files have changed.

### Styling docs

You can make changes to the styling by starting a web server locally:

```shell
make start
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to preview your changes. CSS & JS changes will appear without the need to refresh your
browser.

### Releasing new versions of the documentation

Deployment is handled using continuous deployment via [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/).
Successful builds on the `master` branch will be automatically deployed.

## sphinx-autobuild not found

It might be that the location of the installed pip packages is not included in your `$PATH`.

It's also recommended to use `python3` and `pip3` instead of the pre-installed python 2.7 version which comes with MacOS.

The following steps install `python3` and `pip3` and add the package location to your `$PATH` variable

1. make sure you have homebrew installed (http://brew.sh)
2. install python3, which comes with pip3: `brew install python3`
3. see if the executable works for both python3 and pip3: `which python3 && which pip3`. This command should print two paths
4. `pip3` installs its package executables on `/Users/<your-username>/Library/Python/<version>/bin`. Add this path to your `$PATH` variable. Add `export PATH=/Users/<your-username>/Library/Python/<version>/bin:$PATH"` to your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`.
5. You can choose to alias pip3 to pip. Add this to your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`: `alias pip=pip3`
6. If you did step 5, `make install` will now work. If you didn't. Copy the make install command and replace `pip` with `pip3`.
7. `make start` is now able to run smoothly.
